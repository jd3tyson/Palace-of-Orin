# Palace-of-Orin
Unity 3D game

Unity 3D game created as part of my undergraduate degree. Game can be found <a href="http://jamestyson.co.uk/Orin/orin.html" target="_blank">here</a> 

I do not claim ownership of any of the graphics, textures, terrains or animations; these can all be found on the Unity store The copyright of which belongs to the original owners.

I did however create al script files which can be found in the scripts folder.

*You may want to turn the sound down, the music sounds terrible. Probably fix this at some point*

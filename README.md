Palace of Orin - a Unity 3D game

Unity 3D game created as part of my undergraduate degree.

Some of the assets were found on the Unity Store and I do not claim any ownership of these assets; the copyright of these assets belongs with the creators. I did however create all script files which can be found in the scripts folder and a small number of assets/animations and retain the copyright on these items.

*You may want to turn the sound down, the music sounds terrible. Probably fix this at some point*
